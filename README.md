# REDREAMER
Dream Generating Recurrent Neural Network Experiment

This is based on the [Udacity TV Script Generation project](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation) for the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 
I've deleted the instructions and made some significant revisions in the code. 
The unit tests are still present as of this first commit but I intend to remove and simplify the notebook.

You'll have to add your own data. Any .txt file will work. 

A GPU is necessary to train the network on a dataset of any size.
A CPU will do for generating novel text after the network is trained.

This is designed to work in Python 2.7 and TensorFlow 1.0.1
It will require some modifications to work in Python 3.x and later versions of TensorFlow.
